# Position-induced Transformer

The code in this repository presents six numerical experiments of using Position-induced Transformer (PiT) for learing operators in partial differential equations. PiT is built upon the position-attention mechanism, proposed in the paper *Positional Knowledge is All You Need: Position-induced Transformer (PiT) for Operator Learning*. The paper can be downloaded <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.09285">here</a>.

PiT is discretization convergent, giving consistent and convergent predictions as the input data is refined. On the Darcy2D benchmark, a PiT model trained with data at 43x43 resolution can produce accurate predictions given input data at 421x421 resolution.

PiT can learn the dynamics governed by the incompressible Navier&ndash;Stokes equations, being potential for surrogate modeling of fluids motion. Left: reference vorticity at t=20. Right: predicted vorticity at t=20.

PiT is able to approximate highly nonlinear operators. A PiT model can capture discontinuities displayed in the solutions of hyperbolic PDEs. Top left: one-dimensional inviscid Burgers' equation. Top right: one-dimensional compressible Euler equations. Bottom: two-dimensional compressible Euler equations.

PiT can handle irregular point clouds and effectively treat arbitrary boundary conditions.

## Requirements
- We have run the experiments on a linux OS, with `python==3.10.0`, `CUDA==11.8`, `tensorflow==2.10.0`, and `tensorflow_probability==0.18`. `matplotlib` and `scipy` are also needed for plotting and data loading.
- Since the version of `2.15`, Tensorflow supports installing its NVIDIA CUDA library dependencies through pip. This, for people who know both Tensorflow and PyTorch, represents a great improvement for Tensorflow. We provide the `requirements.txt` file

        --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com
        tensorflow[and-cuda]==2.15
        tensorflow_probability==0.23
        matplotlib
        scipy

    to facilitate running our code with `tensorflow==2.15` and `tensorflow_probability==0.23`. As long as the NVIDIA driver is up to date, simply run
    
    `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
    
    in an environment with `python=3.9-3.11`. This will set up all the necessary dependencies, with no more need for manually installing CUDA stuff.
