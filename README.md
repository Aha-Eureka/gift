# Position-induced Transformer

The code in this repository presents six numerical experiments of using Position-induced Transformer (PiT) for learing operators in partial differential equations. PiT is built upon the position-attention mechanism, proposed in the paper *Positional Knowledge is All You Need: Position-induced Transformer (PiT) for Operator Learning*.

## Requirements
- This code is primarily based on PyTorch. We have observed significant improvements in PiT's training speed with PyTorch 2.x, especially when using `torch.compile`. Therefore, we highly recommend using PyTorch 2.x with `torch.compile` enabled for optimal performance.
- If any issues arise with `torch.compile` that cannot be resolved, the code is also compatible with recent versions of PyTorch 1.x. In such cases, simply comment out the line `model = torch.compile(model)` in the scripts.
- Matplotlib and Scipy are also required.
